Artificial Neural Networks have generated a lot of excitement in Machine Learning research and industry, thanks to many breakthrough results in speech recognition, computer vision and text processing. In this blog post I will try to develop an understanding of   Artificial Neural Networks and show you the practical project of ANN that I have worked on it. I compared different architecture of ANN. \n\nA Single Neuron\r\n\nThe basic unit of computation in a neural network is the neuron, often called a node or unit. It receives input from some other nodes, or from an external source and computes an output. Each input has an associated weight (w), which is assigned on the basis of its relative importance to other inputs. The node applies a function f (defined below) to the weighted sum of its inputs as shown in Figure 1 below:\n\n![ANN - Maryam Bafandkar - Machine learning](/images/uploads/screen-shot-2016-08-09-at-3-42-21-am.png \"Figure 1: a single neuron\")"
