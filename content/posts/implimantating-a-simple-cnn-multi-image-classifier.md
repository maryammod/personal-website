  # What is CNN?


  A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm
  which can take numbers of images, assign parameters (learnable weights and
  biases) to various features/pixels of the images and be able to differentiate
  one from the other. 


  Now, we briefly know what a CNN is and now it is time to answer these
  following questions to implimint our classifier step by step.


  1.  


  **How can I start to run my classifier ?**
