content: "In previous post, we get familiar with the basic concepts of these Neural network types. Now we want to find the answers for these questions:\n\nWhen to Use Multilayer Perceptrons?\n\nWhen to Use Convolutional Neural Networks?\n\nWhen to Use Recurrent Neural Networks?\n\nWhat is Hybrid Network Models and its application ?\n\n## **When to Use Multilayer Perceptrons?**\r\n\nMultilayer Perceptrons, or MLPs for short, are the classical type of neural network.\r\n\nThey are comprised of one or more layers of neurons. Data is fed to the input layer, there may be one or more hidden layers providing levels of abstraction, and predictions are made on the output layer, also called the visible layer.\n\nMLPs are suitable for classification prediction problems where inputs are assigned a class or label.\r\n\nThey are also suitable for regression prediction problems where a real-valued quantity is predicted given a set of inputs. Data is often provided in a tabular format, such as you would see in a CSV file or a spreadsheet.\r\n\n**Use MLPs For:**\r\n\n* Tabular datasets\r\n* Classification prediction problems\r\n* Regression prediction problems\r\n\nThey are very flexible and can be used generally to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.\r\n\nThis flexibility allows them to be applied to other types of data. For example, the pixels of an image can be reduced down to one long row of data and fed into a MLP. The words of a document can also be reduced to one long row of data and fed to a MLP. Even the lag observations for a time series prediction problem can be reduced to a long row of data and fed to a MLP.\r\n\nAs such, if your data is in a form other than a tabular dataset, such as an image, document, or time series, I would recommend at least testing an MLP on your problem. The results can be used as a baseline point of comparison to confirm that other models that may appear better suited add value.\r\n\n**Try MLPs On:**\r\n\n* Image data\r\n* Text Data\r\n* Time series data\r\n* Other types of data\n\n**When to Use Convolutional Neural Networks?**\r\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks, or CNNs, were designed to map image data to an output variable.\r\n\nThey have proven so effective that they are the go-to method for any type of prediction problem involving image data as an input.\r\n\nThe benefit of using CNNs is their ability to develop an internal representation of a two-dimensional image. This allows the model to learn position and scale in variant structures in the data, which is important when working with images.\r\n\n**Use CNNs For:**\r\n\n* Image data\r\n* Classification prediction problems\r\n* Regression prediction problems\r\n* More generally, CNNs work well with data that has a spatial relationship.\r\n\n\rThe CNN input is traditionally two-dimensional, a field or matrix, but can also be changed to be one-dimensional, allowing it to develop an internal representation of a one-dimensional sequence.\r\n\nThis allows the CNN to be used more generally on other types of data that has a spatial relationship. For example, there is an order relationship between words in a document of text. There is an ordered relationship in the time steps of a time series.\r\n\nAlthough not specifically developed for non-image data, CNNs achieve state-of-the-art results on problems such as document classification used in sentiment analysis and related problems.\r\n\n\r\n\nTry CNNs On:\r\n\n\r\n\nText data\r\n\nTime series data\r\n\nSequence input data\n\n\n\n## Hybrid Network Models\r\n\nA CNN or RNN model is rarely used alone.\r\r\n\nThese types of networks are used as layers in a broader model that also has one or more MLP layers. Technically, these are a hybrid type of neural network architecture.\r\n\nPerhaps the most interesting work comes from the mixing of the different types of networks together into hybrid models.\r\n\n**For example,** consider a model that uses a stack of layers with _a CNN on the input_, _LSTM in the middle_, and _MLP at the output_. _A model like this can read a sequence of image inputs, such as a video, and generate a prediction. This is called a CNN LSTM architecture._\r\n\nThe network types can also be stacked in specific architectures to unlock new capabilities, _such as the reusable image recognition models_ that use very deep CNN and MLP networks that can be added to a new LSTM model and used for captioning photos. Also, the encoder-decoder LSTM networks that can be used to have input and output sequences of differing lengths.\r\n\nIt is important to **think clearly** about what you and your stakeholders require from the project first, then seek out a network architecture (or develop one) that meets your specific project needs."
