  # Tensorflow Docker Requirements


  You just need to read[ this page](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/docker)
  and folow all the steps and after that you can run your python editor and
  train your dataset with the Tensorflow.


  But I think knowing about basic concept of Docker is so important to know.
  Because you need to change and install some thing on your container, so if you
  are interested, please read this post about [basic concepts of
  Docker.](https://maryambafandkar.me/installing-anaconda-on-docker-from-scratch)
