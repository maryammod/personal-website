  ## Using AutoEncoder(AE) and convolutional neural network (CNN) and SVM
  approaches


  hybrid deep learning is introduced, which included AutoEncoder(AE) and
  convolutional neural network (CNN). This neural network is applied for
  extracting the features of the plant leaves. In this paper, we proved that
  hybrid deep learning can extract better features for classification task. We
  apply the hybrid deep learning to extract features of leaf pictures, and then
  we classify leaves using those features with SVM, the result suggests that
  this method is not only better than pure SVM, but also better than pure AE and
  pure CNN.
