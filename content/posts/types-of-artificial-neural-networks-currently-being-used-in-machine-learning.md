title: Types of Artificial Neural Networks Currently Being Used in Machine Learning
description: >-
  Artificial neural networks are computational models which work similar to the
  functioning of a human nervous system. There are several kinds of artificial
  neural networks. These type of networks are implemented based on the
  mathematical operations and a set of parameters required to determine the
  output. Lets look at some of the neural networks:
