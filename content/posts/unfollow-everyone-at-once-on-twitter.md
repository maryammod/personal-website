description: >-
  Sometimes you intend to change your field of study or even your life and
  intend to build new real and virtual life.Currently I am in this situation and
  I wanted to unfollow all my followers and following on Twitter to follow some
  new people related to my new life. I share the technique I have found that you
  can unfollow all your followers just by a simple script and one click.

I share the technique I have found that you can unfollow all your followers just by a simple script and one click.\n\nPlease follow these steps:\n\n1. Open https://twitter.com/following\r\n2. Scroll to bottom until all users that you follow are loaded (important)\r\n3. Right-click on an empty area > Inspection\r\n4.
