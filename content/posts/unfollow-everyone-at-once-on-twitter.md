description: >-
  Sometimes you intend to change your field of study or even your life and
  intend to build the new real and virtual life.Currently I am in this situation
  and I want to unfollow all my followers and following on Twitter to follow
  some new people related to my new life. I share the technique I have found
  that you can unfollow all your followers just by a simple script and one
  click.

  Sometimes you intend to change your field of study or even your life and

  some new people related to my new life. I share the technique I have found
  that you can unfollow all your followers just by a simple script and one
  click.


  Please follow these steps:


  1. Open https://twitter.com/following

  2. Scroll to bottom until all users that you follow are loaded (important)

  3. Right-click on an empty area > Inspection

  4. After opening Developer Tools press ESC once to open the Console (if
  needed)

  5. In the Console box type the following code and press enter



  ```

  $('.button-text.unfollow-text').trigger('click')

  ```


  Awesome! No following . And then you can do all these steps for the Followers
  as well.


  Now you are ready to make your new life with new followers and your time would
  not be wasted by the bullshit tweets. ;)


  Enjoy it!
