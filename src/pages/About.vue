              Hi, I‚Äôm Maryam Bafandkar. I am a second-year graduate student in
              the Applied Computer Science program at the University of
              Winnipeg. Hopefully, I will graduate before 2021. I like my
              student life, though. Full-time learning and researching and
              working with well-educated professors and researchers.
            </p>

              Currently, I am doing my research in an amazing and big
              <span class="font-weight-bold">Machine Learning</span> project
              with the University of Winnipeg, University of Saskatoon and other
              two big companies. If you are interested to know more about the
              project I am working on, you can read

              Since I am learning new things and finding some new experience in
              Machine Learning areas, I decided to create my personal website
              where I can share some important and practical things, I know
              about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since my research area is related to plant classification using
              machine learning algorithms, I invented a new CNN architecture
              that is specifically used for plants dataset, called ‚ÄúGeneralist
              and Specialist Algorithm‚Äù, I‚Äôll write a post to explain it in
              detail.
            </p>

            <p>
              I also like to make open-source projects, all of which can be
              found on <strong>GitHub</strong>. A few I'm proud of are:
            </p>
            <ul class="mb-5 ml-5">
              <li>
                Implemented and improved KNN algorithm using parallel
                programming

            </ul>

            <p>Here are a few random things I like:</p>
            <ul class="mb-5 ml-5">
              <li>
                üìö <strong>Books:</strong> follow your heart, A Song of Ice and
                Fire, Demon-Haunted World
              </li>
              <li>
                üéµ <strong>Songs:</strong> Way too many to even get close to the
                listing, but here are a random three: La Noyee (Yann Tiersen),
                Bemyself (Parcels), I Promised Myself (Nick Kamen)
              </li>
              <li>
                üéÆ <strong>Sport:</strong> Climbing the mountain, Swimming
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I also like hiking and biking, I've done a lot of solo travel
              (around Asia and America) and I can speak Persian. My favourite
              instrument is the guitar.
